# EverythingGuitar-Flutter-IKFRAM

During my second year of my studies I had chosen to learn Flutter & Dart, using a Udemy course 
to learn the general concept and the documentations to deepen my knowlegde. Eventually I decided 
to make my own app. I am really into making music and I also give guitar lessons to a few of my 
students. I decided to make an app which could compliment this.

To realise this app I used Cloud Firestore, from Firebase, to host an online database which I 
connected to my app as the back-end. I started with some quick sketches and eventually started 
building. One of the more interesting challenges was passing all the data using providers and 
listeners to limit the amount of passing data manually.
